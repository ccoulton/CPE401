Online Social Network Assignment for CPE401
author Charles Coulton

While warned to the contrary I waited till the last week to start this.
While the server applet and client applet connect and some strings are processed, most of the
functionaty of the project is absent.  This will cause my next project to cost more time as I will
have to finish filling out the stubs of this project before hand.

Functions are stubs/menu options that logic is commented for but not built.
I have a unshown mastery of reading API and making things work but it is not displayed here.
